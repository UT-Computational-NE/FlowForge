class VTKFile:
    """
    The VTKFile Class provides the ability to convert the mesh data into a file
    that is able to be rendering using additional software (i.e. VisIt). This class
    must be initialized with a file path. This will be the name of the file that is
    saved after calling the 'writeFile()' function.
    
    If no data is set using the __setitem__ function, the file will still write with a data list that is set by default to be
    empty. No errors will occur if a mesh is desired with no data values.

        The VTKFile class is initialized with the desired file path of the export file.
